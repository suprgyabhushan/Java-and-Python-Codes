##Synopsis

We need to make a suffix tree in Python using dictionary implementation.

##Code Explanation

I needed to edit dictionary2.py in the form of a suffix tree which is then used in the already coded t9fast.py.
Using suffix trees in dictionary2.py , t9fast.py (by its name) gave fast results than t9slow.py (which uses dictionary1.py which is coded in an ordinary way).

##Use

Suffix Tree is an efficient data-structure for storing a set of words which may have common prefixes. It is also very efficient in searching for words. Hence, it is an ideal data-structure for use in our dictionary implementation.
