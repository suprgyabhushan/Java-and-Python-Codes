1) Write a higher order function mymap(f, l) that takes a function f and an list l and returns an array each of whose elements is obtained by applying f to each corresponding element of l.
Implement the following using your map function.
- a function dblarray that doubles all the elements of an integer list.
- a function add2toarray that adds 2 to all the elements of an integer list.
- a function lenstrlist that returns an list containing the length of of strings in a list.

2) Write a higher order function myreduce(f, l, acc) that generates a final accumulator value using a function f, a list l and an initial accumulator value acc. e.g. say def f(x, y): return x + y, then myreduce(f, [1, 2, 3], 0) = ((0 + 1) + 2) + 3.
Implement the following using your myreduce function.
- a function sumarray that adds all the elements of an integer list.
- a function mularray that adds all the elements of an integer list.
- a function that concatenates all the elements of a string list.
- a function that gives you the full name given a list of first name, middle name and surname.
- a function that counts the number of non-zero elements in an integer list.

3) Write a higher order function myfilter(f, l) that generates a filtered list from a list l by applying a filter function f.
- a function that takes an integer list and returns a sub-list which contains the odd elements.
- a function that takes an integer list and returns a sub-list which contains the even elements.
- a function that takes a string list and returns a sub-list which contains the strings that end with "ing".

4) Implement as many of the sub-functions above using lambda expressions as possible.

5) Write a function f(x) that returns a function which multiplies any number with x.

6) Implement a function greaterEven(l) which takes a list l and returns True if the sum of even numbers in l is greater than the sum of odd numbers in l. False otherwise.

7) Implement a function greaterEvenSquares(l) which takes a list l and returns True if the sum of the squares of all the even numbers in l is greater than the sum of the squares of the odd numbers in l. False otherwise.
